# **EMHASS Setup in Home Assistant**  

## **Overview**  
**[EMHASS (Energy Management for Home Assistant)](https://github.com/davidusb-geek/emhass)** is an open-source tool designed to optimize energy consumption in your smart home. By leveraging real-time data such as electricity prices, solar production, and household energy usage, EMHASS creates schedules to reduce costs and improve efficiency.

This repository documents my setup and configuration for integrating EMHASS with Home Assistant.  

---

## **Features of EMHASS**  
- **Energy Optimization**: Automatically schedules appliances based on electricity prices and solar availability.  
- **Cost Savings**: Reduces energy bills by shifting usage to off-peak hours.  
- **Open-Source & Flexible**: Fully customizable to fit your unique energy setup.  

---

## **My Setup**  

### 1. **Home Assistant**  
- Home Assistant serves as the backbone for my smart home, managing all automations and device integrations.  

### 2. **[Nordpool Integration](https://github.com/custom-components/nordpool)**  
- Nordpool provides real-time electricity prices, enabling EMHASS to make cost-efficient decisions.  

### 3. **Solar Panels & Battery**  
- I use solar panels and a 10kW battery to store excess energy, further enhancing EMHASS’s ability to optimize consumption.

## **How I Integrated EMHASS**  

### **Step 1: Install EMHASS**  
Follow the installation instructions in the official [EMHASS GitHub Repository](https://github.com/davidusb-geek/emhass).  

### **Step 2: Configure EMHASS**  
1. Set up your **electricity prices** (e.g., via Nordpool).  
2. Add your **solar production** and **consumption sensors** in Home Assistant.  
3. Define your **appliance schedules** and optimization goals.  

### **Step 3: Automate with Home Assistant**  
- Create automations in Home Assistant to trigger appliances based on EMHASS-generated schedules.

## **Current Status**  
- **Working Features**:  
  - Scheduling appliances like EV during off-peak hours.  
  - Optimizing battery charging and discharging to maximize solar usage.  

- **Ongoing Improvements**:  
  - Refining sensor inputs for better predictions.  
  - Enhancing integration with my existing Home Assistant automations.
