# **My EMHASS Setup in Home Assistant**  

## **Overview**  
**[EMHASS (Energy Management for Home Assistant)](https://github.com/davidusb-geek/emhass)** is an open-source tool designed to optimize energy consumption in your smart home. By leveraging real-time data such as electricity prices, solar production, and household energy usage, EMHASS creates schedules to reduce costs and improve efficiency.  

This repository documents my setup and configuration for integrating EMHASS with Home Assistant, along with **Solcast**, **Tibber**, and other tools for enhanced energy management.

## **My Setup**  

### 1. **Home Assistant**  
- Home Assistant serves as the core platform, managing all automations, integrations, and device controls.  

### 2. **[Nordpool Integration](https://github.com/custom-components/nordpool)**  
- Provides real-time electricity prices, enabling EMHASS to optimize usage during off-peak hours.  

### 3. **[Tibber Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tibber/)**  
- Fetches detailed electricity price data and consumption statistics directly from Tibber for accurate cost analysis.  

### 4. **[Solcast Integration](https://github.com/dannerph/home_assistant_solcast_solar)**  
- Uses Solcastâ€™s solar forecasting API to predict solar panel production, enabling more efficient scheduling and battery management.  

### 5. **Solar Panels & Battery**  
- A Huawei inverter paired with a 10kW battery to store excess solar energy, further enhancing the optimization potential of EMHASS.

## **How I Integrated EMHASS**  

### **Step 1: Install EMHASS**  
Follow the installation instructions in the official [EMHASS GitHub Repository](https://github.com/davidusb-geek/emhass).  

### **Step 2: Configure Integrations**  
1. **Electricity Prices**: Use **Nordpool** or **Tibber** to provide real-time pricing data.  
2. **Solar Production**: Use **Solcast** to forecast solar energy generation.  
3. **Sensors**: Add your household energy consumption and production sensors in Home Assistant.  

### **Step 3: Automate with EMHASS**  
1. Define optimization goals in EMHASS (e.g., minimizing costs, maximizing renewable energy use).  
2. Create Home Assistant automations to act on EMHASS-generated schedules.
