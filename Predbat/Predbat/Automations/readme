Summary of Automations
1. Predbat Charge:
Manages charging based on time and battery state.

Daytime (06:00–23:30): Charges at 4500W if SOC is 0–97%.
Nighttime (23:30–06:00): Reduces to 2500W if car charging is active.
Improvement: Optimize repeated delays and script calls for efficiency.

2. Predbat Discharge:
Handles battery discharge during exporting.

Discharges at 4500W based on export predictions or SOC.
Improvement: Simplify conditions and ensure discharging doesn't overlap with other triggers.

3. Predbat STOP, Freeze, Hold, Demand:
The automation **"Predbat STOP Freeze Hold Demand"** manages various charging and discharging states for a battery inverter based on the value of the `predbat.status` entity. Here's a summary of its functionality:

### **Triggers:**
- Activated when `predbat.status` changes to any of the following states:
  - **Hold charging**, **Freeze charging**, **Hold exporting**, **Freeze exporting**, **Hold for car**, or **Demand**.

### **Conditions:**
- Executes only if the current state of `predbat.status` matches one of the above states.

### **Actions:**
- **Hold for Car:**  
  - Stops discharging by running the script (`huawei_discharging_power_0w`).

- **Freeze exporting & Hold exporting:**  
  - Stops forced charging via the inverter.  
  - Switches between different charging and discharging modes with delays.

- **Freeze charging & Hold charging:**  
  - Stops forced charging via the inverter.  
  - Adjusts charging power based on:
    - Season (charges at 0W during winter, autumn, and spring; otherwise, charges at 4500W).  
    - Solar input power (`sensor.inverter_input_power` below 1500W).  
  - Stops discharging.

- **Demand:**  
  - Adapts charging/discharging depending on the time of day:
    - **23:00-06:00:** Stops all charging and discharging.  
    - **Otherwise:** Checks battery capacity and solar energy availability to adjust between 0W and 5000W discharging, and 4500W charging.

### **Mode:**
- **Parallel mode:** Allows up to 10 instances of the automation to run simultaneously.

### **Purpose:**
The automation dynamically controls charging and discharging of the battery based on predefined states, time of day, season, and energy availability. It optimizes solar energy usage and protects the battery's lifespan.

Adjusts power levels (0W or 2500W) based on triggers and conditions like time or SOC.
Improvement: Refactor complex "choose" sequences for better readability and maintainability.

Key Adjustments Needed:
Reduce repeated delays and script executions for performance.
Improve readability with clearer logic and variable reuse.
Ensure triggers and actions don't conflict under overlapping conditions.
