Summary of Automations
1. Predbat Charge:
Manages charging based on time and battery state.

Daytime (06:00–23:30): Charges at 4500W if SOC is 0–97%.
Nighttime (23:30–06:00): Reduces to 2500W if car charging is active.
Improvement: Optimize repeated delays and script calls for efficiency.

2. Predbat Discharge:
Handles battery discharge during exporting.

Discharges at 4500W based on export predictions or SOC.
Improvement: Simplify conditions and ensure discharging doesn't overlap with other triggers.

3. Predbat STOP, Freeze, Hold, Demand:
Controls freeze/hold states for charging and exporting.

Adjusts power levels (0W or 2500W) based on triggers and conditions like time or SOC.
Improvement: Refactor complex "choose" sequences for better readability and maintainability.

Key Adjustments Needed:
Reduce repeated delays and script executions for performance.
Improve readability with clearer logic and variable reuse.
Ensure triggers and actions don't conflict under overlapping conditions.
