My Setup

Home Assistant: Ensure you have Home Assistant installed and running.
Nordpool Integration: Set up the Nordpool integration in Home Assistant to get electricity prices.
Huawei Inverter: Ensure your Huawei inverter is connected to Home Assistant.
10kW Battery: Verify that your 10kW battery is properly installed and configured.

This project is still a work in progress, and I'm continuously making improvements. For instance, I'm currently refining my Predbat configuration to enhance stability and reduce the number of automation scripts. 

Iâ€™m not an expert in programming, but with the help of Google, documentation, and persistence, I usually find solutions to most challenges.
