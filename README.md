# **Welcome to My EMHASS and Predbat Setup**  

## **Overview**  
This project optimizes energy consumption in my smart home using two powerful tools:  
- **[EMHASS (Energy Management for Home Assistant)](https://github.com/davidusb-geek/emhass)**  
- **[Predbat (Home Battery Prediction)](https://github.com/arti5020/predbat)**  

These tools integrate with Home Assistant to reduce energy costs and maximize the efficiency of my 10kW home battery.
